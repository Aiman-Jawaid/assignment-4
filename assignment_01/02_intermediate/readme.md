## 📂 What’s Inside?

### 🔄 **Control Flow For Console**
Control flow is at the heart of every program. This section covers the basics of controlling the flow of execution in your code using **if-else statements**, **loops**, and other decision-making techniques. These exercises will help you create dynamic programs that respond to different conditions.

- Learn to control your program’s flow with `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
- Work with loops to repeat actions (using `for` and `while`).
- Create basic interactive programs.

### 🐍 **Intro To Python**
If you're new to Python, this section is your starting point. It introduces you to Python’s syntax, basic operations, and simple programs that will help you get started with the language.

- Understand how to run Python scripts.
- Work with variables, strings, and basic math.
- Get comfortable with user input and output.
- Start building simple programs with Python!

### 📚 **Lists And Dicts**
Lists and dictionaries are powerful data structures in Python. This section covers how to use these to store, organize, and manipulate data effectively.

- Learn how to create, access, and modify lists and dictionaries.
- Practice working with list methods like `.append()`, `.remove()`, and `.sort()`.
- Work with dictionary key-value pairs for quick lookups and data management.
