## 🧩 What's Inside?

### `00_joke_bot.py`
🤖 *The Joke Machine*  
Feeling down? Let the joke bot lift your spirits! This script will tell you a joke when you ask. Perfect for learning basic string manipulation and user interaction.

### `01_double_it.py`
🔢 *Double Trouble*  
Want to see a number get bigger? This script takes a number from you and doubles it. Simple, but a great intro to math in Python!

### `02_liftoff.py`
🚀 *3...2...1...Liftoff!*  
A countdown timer! Watch as it ticks down from 10 to liftoff. Great practice for loops, `time.sleep()`, and simulating a launch!

### `03_guess_my_number.py`
🎯 *Guess the Number Game*  
Test your guessing skills! The computer picks a number, and you try to guess it. A classic for practicing random number generation and conditional statements.

### `04_random_numbers.py`
🎲 *Random Number Fun*  
This script generates random numbers for you to work with. From dice rolls to random selections, it’s a great way to practice using Python’s `random` module.
