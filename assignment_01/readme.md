## 🏁 Assignment Breakdown

### 01_basics
The **Basics** folder contains beginner-level exercises that focus on foundational Python concepts, such as variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions. These are designed to give you a strong understanding of Python syntax and simple problem-solving.

- **Examples**: 
  - Working with numbers and strings
  - Using `if` statements and loops
  - Basic functions and user input handling

### 02_intermediate
The **Intermediate** folder dives deeper into Python’s capabilities, including working with data structures (like lists and dictionaries), handling errors, and introducing more complex logic. These assignments are great for expanding your understanding and tackling more real-world problems.

- **Examples**:
  - Using lists, tuples, and dictionaries
  - Handling exceptions and errors
  - Writing more complex functions and algorithms
