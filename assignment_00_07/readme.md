# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to your Python learning path! This repo is structured to take you from the absolute basics to writing your own functions and managing information flow in Python. Each folder contains example code and exercises related to a core concept.

---

## 📁 00_intro_python
**Objective:** Get comfortable with basic Python syntax and running your first script.

- Print statements
- Variables
- Comments
- Simple input/output

---

## 📁 01_expressions
**Objective:** Learn how to perform calculations and work with different data types.

- Arithmetic operations
- Integer vs float
- Type conversion
- Using the `round()` function

---

## 📁 02_lists
**Objective:** Understand how to store and manage multiple items using Python lists.

- Creating and modifying lists
- Accessing elements with indexes
- List methods like `append()`, `remove()`, `len()`
- Slicing lists

---

## 📁 03_if_statements
**Objective:** Make decisions in code using conditions.

- `if`, `elif`, `else` logic
- Comparison and logical operators
- Nesting conditions
- Boolean expressions

---

## 📁 04_dictionaries
**Objective:** Use key-value pairs to store and retrieve structured data.

- Creating dictionaries
- Accessing and updating values
- Iterating through keys/values
- Dictionary methods like `get()`, `items()`, and `update()`

---

## 📁 05_loops_control_flow
**Objective:** Learn how to repeat actions using loops and control how the program flows.

- `for` loops and `while` loops
- Looping through lists and dictionaries
- `break` and `continue`
- Nested loops and loop control patterns

---

## 📁 06_functions
**Objective:** Write reusable blocks of code using functions.

- Defining functions with `def`
- Parameters and return values
- Function scope (local vs global)
- Reusability and code organization

---

## 📁 07_information_flow
**Objective:** Understand how data moves through a program and across functions.

- Passing data between functions
- Return values and chaining logic
- Inputs and outputs in larger programs
- Program structure and modularity

---

### 🚀 Tips
- Run small pieces of code often as you learn.
- Use `print()` to debug and check what’s going on.
- Don’t worry if you make mistakes—that’s part of learning!
- Ask questions, explore, and have fun with Python 🐍
