# 🧩 Python Functions & Return Values

This mini-collection is all about **functions**, **return statements**, and making decisions in code. Each script shows how Python can evaluate something, return a result, and let other parts of your program use that result. 📦➡️

## 📂 File Overview

| 📄 File Name | 🧠 Description |
|--------------|----------------|
| `00_choosing_returns.py` | 🤔 Returns different values based on logic or input — great for mastering control flow inside functions. |
| `01_greetings.py` | 👋 A function that returns a greeting message. Small but useful to learn how to format and return strings. |
| `02_in_range.py` | 🎯 Checks whether a number is within a certain range and returns `True`/`False`. Classic condition practice. |
| `03_in_stock.py` | 📦 Simulates an inventory check — returns availability based on input. Useful intro to conditional checks with data. |
| `04_multiple_returns.py` | 🔁 A function that can return different outcomes depending on the situation — great for multi-branch logic. |
| `05_subtract_7.py` | ➖ A simple function that subtracts 7 from a given number. Clean and concise math practice. |

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- ✍️ Writing custom Python functions
- 🔁 Returning values from logic checks
- 📏 Using `if`/`else` statements inside functions
- 📤 How to reuse logic by calling functions multiple times

## ▶️ How to Run

1. 🐍 Make sure Python is installed (download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) if needed).
2. 🔍 Open a file in your Python editor or IDE.
3. 🧪 Run the file and observe the returned results (either printed or used in another function).
4. 🧑‍🔬 Try modifying inputs to test different return values!

## 💡 Ideas to Expand

- Use `in_stock.py` with a dictionary of inventory items.
- Add error checking (e.g., what if input isn’t a number?).
- Turn `greetings.py` into a chatbot-style greeter.
- Have `multiple_returns.py` return a tuple of values instead of just one!

You're now entering the world of reusable, modular code. Functions are how real software is built — and you're already doing it! 💪💻
