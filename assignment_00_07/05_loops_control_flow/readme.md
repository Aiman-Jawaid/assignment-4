## 🎮 What’s Inside?

| 📄 File Name | 🤔 What It Does |
|--------------|----------------|
| `00_guess_my_number.py` | 🎯 A guessing game where you try to find the secret number. Fun and great for learning loops & conditionals. |
| `01_fibonacci.py` | 🌀 Prints the Fibonacci sequence — a classic math pattern using loops. |
| `02_print_events.py` | 📣 Displays specific messages or events based on logic (if statements or input). |
| `03_wholesome_machine.py` | 🌈 Delivers kind, uplifting messages — because coding should feel good too! |
| `04_liftoff.py` | 🚀 A countdown script leading to liftoff! Great for loops and timing. |
| `05_double_it.py` | ✖️ Takes a number and doubles it — a tiny app that shows the power of simple input/output.
